# these are lock's outer shell
and u 100% need to adjust this design to fit ur usage
# file explain
arduino-uno.stp.SLDPRT: is uno board model that i found on internet, however i got a different board, thus the design here isn't align perfectly
battery.SLDPRT: i took one of my battery bank to se if it can fit in, act as backup battery
lever.sldprt: the lever that i use
Part6.SLDPRT: this is where mfrc522 should hold, and also act as a holding part for part6b
Part6b.SLDPRT: this is the part hold rest of components
rfid-readwrite-module-rc522.SLDPRT: mfrc522 model
LockHousing.SLDASM: parts all together
# the file that u need to print is one part6b and TWO part6 if u go with my design
remeber to check the size for each component, the part that i use isn't common

and i didn't have a place for super sonic, i just glued it
